## Description

The last web font kits for the Lato family was updated to version 2.015.
These fonts come in two flavors:   

* Lato with full character set
* LatoLatin with just the Latin characters

The web font kits include WOFF2, WOFF, EOT and TTF. 

We exclude SVG as a deprecated feature with support being removed from browsers.

Of course you can compile SVG if you need it.

We recommend next SVG Font Tools for this goal:

1. [The Apacheâ„¢ Batik Project](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/)

2. [FontForge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/)

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

*npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js,
 you automatically get npm installed on your computer.*

 * [gulp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli)

 *gulp-cli is Command Line Utility for Gulp. just run in the command line:*

      npm install --global gulp-cli

### Installing

* Open the command line in the project folder and run:

      npm i -D gulp@next gulp-decompress gulp-sass gulp-sourcemaps babel-preset-env babel-register del

      npm i

      gulp

(minified and non-minified) in the folder dist/css if you want to use font-face method.
Also, you've two Map files for both css in the folder dist/css/maps

### Deployment

Of course, you've a free choice. Not necessary get full web fonts kit if you need some fonts only.
That's very simple.

* Open the file booster/paths.js in yours preffered text editor and comment on unnecessary fonts.
For example:

        `${ srcPath }/fonts/Lato-Black.zip`,
        // `${ srcPath }/fonts/Lato-BlackItalic.zip`,
        // `${ srcPath }/fonts/Lato-Bold.zip`,
        // `${ srcPath }/fonts/Lato-BoldItalic.zip`,
        // `${ srcPath }/fonts/Lato-Hairline.zip`,
        // `${ srcPath }/fonts/Lato-HairlineItalic.zip`

* Now open the file source/styles/core/fonts.scss and repeat last action. For example:

        @import 'fonts/Lato-Black';
        // @import 'fonts/Lato-BlackItalic';
        // @import 'fonts/Lato-Bold';
        // @import 'fonts/Lato-BoldItalic';
        // @import 'fonts/Lato-Hairline';
